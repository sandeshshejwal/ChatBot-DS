DESCRIPTION : An artificial intelligence (AI) software program termed as a chatbot carries out communication via an audio and video system. Any query can be posed to the chatbot, and it will respond appropriately. A chatbot is becoming a more and more common kind of computer communication today. The chatbot system is popular, therefore many websites are using it. One doesn't even need to search for online purchasing with the chatbotâ€”they may immediately speak to the customer service line. A chatbot can be used to order food, propose products, provide customer service, check the weather, help with personal finances, organise meetings, find and monitor flights, send money, and many other things. Creating a web API is the primary goal that we will explore in this article, and the primary goal that will be covered in this essay is the creation of a web API, as well as some sample web and text messaging interfaces that show how to use API. We are attempting to comprehend these chatbots in this research article and identify their drawbacks.
